## Project Workflow
Does not meet expectations. There is no evidence of any planning materials for this project

## Technical Requirements
Meets/exceeds expectations. I'm really happy you were able to get file uploading to work. I'm also very happy that you were able to customize a devise model, that can be really tricky. For a full exceeds, I really wanted to see you make the request functionality actually be associated between two models. To be able to create requests as a user, and be able to accept requests as a user. Let me know if you have any questions about this domain model.

## Code Quality
Meets Expectations. Code is properly indented for the most part. There are some comments sprinkled throughout, but alot of scaffolded comments. Create comments for your new strong parameter adjustments in your application controller, and other things like that.

## Deployment and Functionality
Meets/exceeds Expectations. Was really happy with the final result of your project. I'm really impressed you were able to get file uploading to work on your application, I still have yet to do that! Would really love too see you implement more user involvement for requests(ie being able to take on a request as a user.)
